Mercurium C/C++ Compiler
========================

Mercurium is a source-to-source compilation infrastructure aimed at fast
prototyping. Current supported languages are C, C++ and Fortran. Mercurium is
mainly used in Nanos environment to implement OpenMP but since it is quite
extensible it has been used to implement other programming models or compiler
transformations, examples include Cell Superscalar, Software Transactional
Memory, Distributed Shared Memory or the ACOTES project, just to name a few.

Extending Mercurium is achieved using a plugin architecture, where plugins
represent several phases of the compiler. These plugins are written in C++ and
dynamically loaded by the compiler according to the chosen configuration. Code
transformations can be implemented in terms of source code (there is no need to
modify or know the internal syntactic representation of the compiler).
