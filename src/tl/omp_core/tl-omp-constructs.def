// These macros are defined in several places to automatically generate all OpenMP support
// 
// OMP_CONSTRUCT(class_name, construct_subclasse, attr_name, functor_name)
//    * construct_name an identifier used to build names
//    * class_name is the name of the class, e.g. ParallelConstruct
//    * construct_subclasse is either DataEnvironmentConstruct or Construct
//    * attr_name is the related attribute in the AST marking the node holding that construct
//    * functor_name is the name of the functor
//
// OMP_DIRECTIVE is the same as OMP_CONSTRUCT but for directives
