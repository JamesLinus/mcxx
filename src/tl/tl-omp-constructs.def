// These macros are defined in several places to automatically generate all OpenMP support
// 
// OMP_CONSTRUCT(class_name, construct_subclasse, attr_name, functor_name, on_name)
//    * class_name is the name of the class, e.g. ParallelConstruct
//    * construct_subclasse is either DataEnvironmentConstruct or Construct
//    * attr_name is the related attribute in the AST marking the node holding that construct
//    * functor_name is the name of the functor declared inside OpenMPPhase
//    * on_name is the name of the signal, two signals are generated
//    on_name_pre and on_name_post for preorder and postorder, respectively
// 
// OMP_CONSTRUCT_MAP is like OMP_CONSTRUCT, use it only for CustomConstruct. It
// will not define any functor, signal and will not add the functor in the
// traversal (these things are already in the code)
